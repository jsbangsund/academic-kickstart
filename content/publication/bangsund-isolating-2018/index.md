abstract = "In this work, we studied the kinetics of OLED degradation. We found that device photoluminescence (PL) stability is more sensitive to exciton density, whereas the exciton formation (EF) stability is more strongly impacted by charge carriers. Through this work, we further developed new measurement techniques to quantify the various pathways of OLED efficiency loss."
